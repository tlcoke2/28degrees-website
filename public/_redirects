# Single Page Apps for GitHub Pages

#
# This is a single page app that uses client-side routing (React Router).
# We need to configure the server to always serve index.html for any request path.
#
# The following directives will redirect requests from /some-path to /some-path/index.html.
# If index.html doesn't exist, it will serve the 404.html page.

# Redirect all requests to index.html
/*    /index.html   200
